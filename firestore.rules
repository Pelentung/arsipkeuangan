/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Contract Management Application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own profile data and the contracts associated with their account.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, where {userId} must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/contracts/{contractId}: Stores contracts owned by a specific user.  The {userId} path segment enforces ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents and contracts.
 * - Listing contracts is restricted to the contracts of a specific user, improving query performance and security.
 * - Data consistency between the path and document data is enforced during creation and updates to prevent unauthorized access.
 * - The rules are designed to avoid costly `get()` operations by relying on path-based authorization.
