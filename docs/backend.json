    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure secure and efficient management of user contracts. It leverages path-based ownership for private user data, and denormalization to maintain authorization independence. This approach avoids using `get()` calls in security rules, enabling atomic operations and simplifies debugging. The structure also facilitates secure listing operations.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n*   `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles. This collection provides a central location for user information and utilizes path-based ownership ensuring only the user (or admins) can access their profile data.\n*   `/users/{userId}/contracts/{contractId}`: Stores contracts owned by a specific user. The `userId` in the path enforces ownership.  No denormalization is needed here as authorization is directly tied to the path.  This enables QAPs because listing contracts is restricted to the contracts of a specific user.\n*   `/users/{userId}/contracts/{contractId}/bills/{billId}`: Stores individual bills related to a contract as a subcollection. This creates a strong hierarchical relationship and ensures bills are queried within the context of a contract."
